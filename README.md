# Rolly-Ball
A 3D Puzzle game prototype created in Unity

I created this game to experiment with 3D graphics in Unity. I started off by completing a simple Unity tutorial that allowed me to move a ball around a platform.
I then continued to add elements to create a puzzle game prototype.

### Key Objectives of this Personal Project
- Use a singleton pattern that allows music controller to play througout all stages of the game
- Implement switches that affect the game world
- Create a 3D object to be used as tokens in game

### Stretch Goals
- Created 3 additional levels
- Created custom sound effects
- Conducted play test research with friends and family
